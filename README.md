EScope with STM32 extension a software oscilloscope designed to be used with the ADC on STM32 microdevices.

## Screenshots

EScope sampling data from an STM32H723 card:

In this animated gif an audio signal from a youtube video 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZyb_wIjKCk) is being fed 
into the ADC of the STM32H723 running at a sampling rate of
20 kHz.

## Setup

To connect the audio output from some source device, the following
circuit is used. In this case the circuit connects the audio output
of a raspberry pi to the STM32H7 device.

## Features

EScope can display one trace from one input on the STM32H723 device,
optionally using the input as a trigger input. As on
physical digital storage oscilloscopes, input signals can be DC or AC
coupled. The vertical gain and offset can be adjusted by dragging
corresponding user interface elements.
